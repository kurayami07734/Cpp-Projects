# `list` container

1. It is implemented using doubly linked list
2. It is useful for fast insertion & deletion (constant time complexity)

## Main methods of `list`

1. `push_back()` inserts element to the end of the list
2. `push_front()` inserts element to the beginning of the list
3. `pop_front()` removes element from the beginning of the list
4. `pop_back()` removes element from the end of the list
5. `insert(iterator, key)`
6. `erase(iterator)`
7. `remove(key)` all occurrences of the key are removed
