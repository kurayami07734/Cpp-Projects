# Linear Data Structures

## [Linked Lists](../../DataStructures/LinkedList/include/list.hpp)

The most basic of them all. (I've implemented singly linked list here)
Using node pointers, LL class store head and tail pointers and the length

### Operations

1. Insertion (at the ends) ($`O(1)`$ time)
2. Deletion (at the ends) ($`O(1)`$ time)
3. Reverse ($`O(N)`$ time)
4. Sort (selection sort with swapping values) ($`O(N)`$ time)

## [Stack](../../DataStructures/Stack/include/Stack.hpp)

Implemented stack using node pointers.
Class stores top pointer and a length variable

### Operations

1. Push ($`O(1)`$ time)
2. Pop ($`O(1)`$ time)


## [Queue](../../DataStructures/Queue/include/Queue.hpp)

Implemented queue using node pointers.
Class stores front and back pointer and a length variable.

### Operations

1. Enqueue ($`O(1)`$ time)
2. Dequeue ($`O(1)`$ time)
