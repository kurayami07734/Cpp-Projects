# Big $O$ Notation

- It is used to analyze the time or space complexity of a
  given algorithm.
- The $`O(f(N))`$ represents the limiting behaviour of the algorithm as $`N\to \infty`$
- $`f(N)`$ can be any mathematical function but some common ones are listed below

  | Big $`O`$      |       Common Name       |
  | :------------- | :---------------------: |
  | $`O(1)`$       |   Constant time/space   |
  | $`O(N)`$       |    Linear time/space    |
  | $`O(N^2)`$     |  Quadratic time/space   |
  | $`O(log(N))`$  | Logarithmic time/space  |
  | $`O(Nlog(N))`$ | Linearithmic time/space |
  | $`O(2^N)`$     | Exponential time/space  |
  | $`O(N!)`$      |  Factorial time/space   |

- Big O is assigned based on worst case scenario
